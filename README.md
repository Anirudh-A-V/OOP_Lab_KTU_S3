## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. go to the directory of the program you want to run
3. Open the terminal in that directory
4. Type `javac <filename>.java` to compile the program
5. Then type `java <filename>` to run the program
6. If you want to run the program with input, type `java <filename> < input.txt` in the terminal
7. If you want to run the program with output, type `java <filename> > output.txt` in the terminal
